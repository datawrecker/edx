And then we will see how we can use that to</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="15089" data-index="3">model the motion of a quadrotor depending on the thrust of its motors.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="21600" data-index="4">So kinematics in general describes the motion of rigid bodies. Typically you can describe</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="29240" data-index="5">the state of rigid body then in classical mechanics by its position in space, by its current velocity,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="37080" data-index="6">and by its acceleration. And then you can find very simple rules. You know</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="43100" data-index="7">that if you integrate up acceleration you get the velocity.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="47100" data-index="8">If you integrate velocity you get position.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="51049" data-index="9">And just to immediately give you an example how this might look like: imagine that we</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="55780" data-index="10">are looking at a rigid body that is living in a 1 dimensional world. So we can describe</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="62600" data-index="11">its position just by using a scalar x, describing its position in space.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="70100" data-index="12">We can describe its speed also by a single scalar x dot,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="75490" data-index="13">and then, its current acceleration by x double dot.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="80010" data-index="14">And then, we can apply an action. To add that in our example, now just changes are being added to the acceleration</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="89400" data-index="15">of this object. And we need a time constant delta t that tells us how much time passes</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="95920" data-index="16">by form one moment to the next.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="99490" data-index="17">And given that we can specify a linear process model that tells us how we can evolve our</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="107890" data-index="18">state from time step t-1 to time step t. And you have probably seen that before you can</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="116200" data-index="19">say that the current position equals the previous position plus delta t times our current speed.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="125250" data-index="20">This is the first row of this system matrix, in the second row we have the relationship</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="132860" data-index="21">that the current speed depends on the previous speed plus delta t times our current acceleration.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="141000" data-index="22">And we just keep the acceleration the same as long as nothing else happens. And then,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="149400" data-index="23">to this state we add our control input u. Just by this simple vector 0,0,1, which just means</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="158370" data-index="24">that we add the action to our acceleration. And using that you can already get a simple dynamical</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="168410" data-index="25">system of an object that floats in 1 dimensional space.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="174209" data-index="26">Now dynamics is the theory that relates forces and torques to such accelerations, as you</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="186230" data-index="27">might know from school: forces induce a linear acceleration on the body, while torques induce</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="192230" data-index="28">an angular acceleration. You can say that a torque is the turning-force that makes something turn.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="198300" data-index="29">Let's start with forces first, a force can be represented by a vector and they can be</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="208510" data-index="30">summed up. So if you for example apply two forces to</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="215020" data-index="31">this soccer ball here in x and y direction, then this corresponds exactly to the force as if you</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="220400" data-index="32">would have applied a force along this diagonal line F_x + F_y.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="227319" data-index="33">And the force that you apply to an object directly relates to the acceleration that</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="232620" data-index="34">this object perceives. And this acceleration then also depends on</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="240519" data-index="35">the mass of the object, so a heavier object is more difficult of course to be accelerated</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="246959" data-index="36">or to be moved.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="249550" data-index="37">A torque you can say, loosely speaking, is the turning-force.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="256700" data-index="38">So if you have a lever arm that you try to move you can apply a force on one side</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="261789" data-index="39">and that will induce then a torque on the rotation axis.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="267199" data-index="40">And this torque that is generated depends on two things: it depends on the force of</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="272759" data-index="41">course, the more force you apply to a lever arm the more torque you get. And then again,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="278500" data-index="42">it depends on the distance of the place where you apply the force and the rotation center</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="286039" data-index="43">which is denoted here in this graphics by r.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="288990" data-index="44">And as before, it also depends on the mass or the mass distribution on the object, which</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="294699" data-index="45">is typically captured by this inertial matrix J here that then relates the torque to the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="304449" data-index="46">angular acceleration, here denoted by bold alpha.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="310889" data-index="47">And now let's see how this translate to quadrotors. As you have seen before, the quadrotor consists</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="318979" data-index="48">of 4 propellers, and every propeller generates some thrust. And this induces a certain force,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="325710" data-index="49">so we have now 4 sources of force that push the quadrotor up.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="332629" data-index="50">And we have the gravitational force that pulls the quadrotor down at the same time.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="338319" data-index="51">And if we count all of this forces together in the vertical case then the quadrotor hovers</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="346700" data-index="52">exactly in place, if the thrust forces of all for rotors exactly match the gravitational</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="353330" data-index="53">force that pulls it down again.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="355800" data-index="54">And at the same time, every propeller also induces the torque, which is the counter torque</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="361800" data-index="55">that's generated by the propellers moving the air.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="368389" data-index="56">And we have to make sure that all of this torques actually sum to 0, in order not to get any motion.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="375089" data-index="57">So this graphics shows again, now if we want to hover in place all of the 4 forces have</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="381419" data-index="58">to equal the gravitational force, if it's larger, then we actually accelerate to the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="388319" data-index="59">top.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="388559" data-index="60">So the resulting force is the force that is being applied to the body of the quadrotor.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="395869" data-index="61">Now if we turn the quadrotor slightly, then this thrust force is not in a line any more</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="402869" data-index="62">with the gravitation. And this means that we can separate this resulting force from the motor thrust</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="415800" data-index="63">into a vertical component F_z that compensates then for the gravity or that has to compensate</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="421139" data-index="64">for the gravity if you want to keep the same position. And an x and y component that actually</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="426500" data-index="65">makes the quadrotor go forward or sideways.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="431289" data-index="66">And because all of these forces are actually vectors, we have to transform the thrust vector</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="443309" data-index="67">into the global coordinate system by using for example a rotation matrix to be able to</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="451610" data-index="68">compute the acceleration in global coordinates.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="457529" data-index="69">Then if we want to change the attitude of our quadrotor, we can bring the motors into</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="466889" data-index="70">a mode where the two opposite motors produce  a unequal thrust, and this then induces a</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="473700" data-index="71">certain torque around the rotation axis or the center of the mass of the quadrotor.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="479429" data-index="72">And again, by the formula from a few slides before we can then compute the resulting torque and that leads giving</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="487000" data-index="73">that inertial matrix J to a certain induced angular acceleration alpha.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="493369" data-index="74">And then for rotating around the vertical axis we can also modulate the speeds of the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="504199" data-index="75">rotors in such a way that the sum of the torques does not equals 0 any more, but the left</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="512370" data-index="76">turning motors are turning faster than the right turning ones for example. And that</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="515809" data-index="77">induces the torque on the overall system.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="520380" data-index="78">So this already summarizes this video, we have looked at rigid body kinematics. Just</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="526530" data-index="79">remember that every rigid body can be described using its position, velocity, and acceleration.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="533080" data-index="80">And then we looked at what accelerations forces and torques actually produce.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="542600" data-index="81">And then, we just applied that to quadrotors because this is what we need.</li><li tabindex="-1" style="height: 196px;" class="spacing"></li></ol>
