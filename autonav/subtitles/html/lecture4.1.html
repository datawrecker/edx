It just consists of two things, namely the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="21970" data-index="4">stationary magnet on the outside, and then an  electromagnet on the axis that is able to spin.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="31000" data-index="5">The electromagnet, when it is switched on, uses a magnetic field. And that in turn uses a</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="37170" data-index="6">torque on the axis, and this makes the axis spin. To align the magnetic field of the electro</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="47410" data-index="7">magnets with the permanent magnet on the outside.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="51070" data-index="8">But then this motion comes to a rest as soon as the magnets are aligned. And when this</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="58769" data-index="9">happens typically a split ring changes the direction of the current such that the motion</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="64940" data-index="10">of the motor continues.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="65580" data-index="11">The principle is very simple, which means that you can easily build one yourself, maybe</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="72410" data-index="12">you already build one at school, as visualized here in the middle image.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="80400" data-index="13">Also the advantage of DC motors is that you can make them super small so that they are</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="84830" data-index="14">really suited well for nano-quadrotors like the CrazyFlie depicted on the right.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="93240" data-index="15">To control the speed of a DC motor you have to adjust the power. So if you give more voltage</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="100720" data-index="16">to the motor it will start spinning faster, and if you reduce the voltage then the rotation will slow down.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="109360" data-index="17">But the problem of course is that we have a micro controller or a computer</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="114890" data-index="18">from which we want to specify the motor speed. So the question is how can we actually modulate the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="121150" data-index="19">power using a digital signal?</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="123080" data-index="20">And then, a common approach that is implemented in hardware in most micro controllers is the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="128850" data-index="21">so called pulse width modulation, also abbreviated as PWM.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="134370" data-index="22">And there the idea is that you have a digital signal that you switch on and off very quickly</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="139650" data-index="23">at a certain frequency.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="146260" data-index="24">And then the amount of time that the signal is switched on during this period is called the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="152410" data-index="25">duty cycle. And the larger this duty cycle is, with respect</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="156310" data-index="26">to the full period, the more power you actually transmit.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="166400" data-index="27">So for example, if the duty cycle is 0 then you do not power at all the motor. If the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="173960" data-index="28">duty cycle is during the whole period, then you would power it at full speed.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="182030" data-index="29">You can continuously smoothly change this duty cycle and in this way regulate the speed</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="187880" data-index="30">or the output power for the motor.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="192920" data-index="31">Of course this digital signal then needs to be amplified using a MOSFET. For example,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="198660" data-index="32">to actually generate the high current that you need for powering the motors.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="204970" data-index="33">An alternative to DC motors are the so called brushless motors. There you have the electro</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="209510" data-index="34">magnets on the outside and they are stationary. And then you have permanent magnets on the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="215280" data-index="35">axis, and this axis can either be in between the coils or outside around the coils.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="225640" data-index="36">We need at least three coils for building a brushless motor. But most brushless motors</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="231760" data-index="37">used in practice have much more, as you can see here in the images.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="236110" data-index="38">The advantage of brushless motor is that you don't have brushes, you don't need a split</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="240030" data-index="39">ring to reverse the current. And that means that motors need less maintenance</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="244640" data-index="40">you never need to replace the brushes there is less mechanics.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="249530" data-index="41">And also the efficiency is much higher because you can regulate better the power that you</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="257029" data-index="42">give to the electro magnets.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="258329" data-index="43">The brushless controller is a little bit more complicated than a controller for a DC motor</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="262620" data-index="44">you need some electronics. But before we go into the details, let's first</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="266880" data-index="45">have a look at the wiring scheme of such a brushless motor, shown here on bottom left.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="272480" data-index="46">Typically the three coils that you have are connected to three pols A, B and C. And then</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="279300" data-index="47">the other side of the coil is soldered together between all coils.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="284430" data-index="48">And then, you setting a certain current between two coils, for example between A and B or</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="290870" data-index="49">between B and C. And you setting an AC signal there and the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="304190" data-index="50">signal between these pairs of coils is shifted by 120 degrees. And that induces a rotary</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="311639" data-index="51">magnetic field then on the coils and that will make the axes of the brushless motor spin</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="318639" data-index="52">at the frequency of these three signals.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="326620" data-index="53">And so you need to have a micro controller that is able to generate such phases at the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="336040" data-index="54">desired speed. And for that you typically need a micro controller that then outputs</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="342180" data-index="55">a PWM signal again for the three motor phases.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="344550" data-index="56">Now, in this case it's again possible to convert this PWM signal using an AC converter, just</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="353960" data-index="57">consisting of a capacitor and a MOSFET chip to improve the power output because the micro controller </li><li tabindex="0" data-start="358600" data-index="58">can't power directly the motor of course or the electro magnets.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="363760" data-index="59">So you run then to an AC converter and that gives you then an analog output. And that</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="368169" data-index="60">are the three phases for the motor.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="371830" data-index="61">You can buy such motor controllers very cheaply, here in this picture on the right you can</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="377110" data-index="62">see such a controller. It's very small, it gets the power from the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="383040" data-index="63">battery with the two thick red and black cables. And it then outputs the three motor phases in the left.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="394050" data-index="64">And for actually reading in the signal you have the small thin cable that goes then to</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="402540" data-index="65">the autopilot board of the quadrotor.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="407600" data-index="66">On interesting thing is that you can actually</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="410800" data-index="67">measure the position and the speed of the motor by evaluating the electromagnetic response</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="417610" data-index="68">on this three motor phases and in this way the motor controller can tell you whether</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="421580" data-index="69">the motor got stuck or whether it's rotating at the right speed. And of course you can also</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="425460" data-index="70">use that to achieve the exactly desired rotation speed.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="432600" data-index="71">So to communicate with the autopilot board, you could again use the PWM signal. But it's</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="439080" data-index="72">even more efficient to have a micro controller for the motor controller and you have a PC</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="447220" data-index="73">or again a micro controller for the autopilot. So a digital protocol is more efficient.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="454030" data-index="74">And then one protocol that is used a lot is the I^2C-Protocol, which is just a serial</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="459900" data-index="75">connection, a parallel bus. The cool thing is you can connect all motors then to the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="466030" data-index="76">same I^2C bus. The individual slaves are addressed using</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="476490" data-index="77">an address and you can transmit at really high speeds.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="482919" data-index="78">This is typically used as I said to communicate the motor speed from the autopilot board to</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="490110" data-index="79">the motor controller. And the actual motor speed or the actual motor properties are </li><li tabindex="0" data-start="495300" data-index="80">send back to the autopilot.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="501500" data-index="81">Just to fill that in with a nice example, this is now taken from the Parrot ArDrone,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="506699" data-index="82">but you can find similar constructions on other quadrotors as well.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="512059" data-index="83">This is the motor board or the motor component of the ArDrone. It consists of the brushless</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="518740" data-index="84">motor of course. On the inside the motors has three cables coming out of it</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="522619" data-index="85">for the three motor phases. And these phases are driven by the AC converters,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="528350" data-index="86">those are the three chips here on the right. And then there is a small AVR CPU, this is</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="535240" data-index="87">for the micro controller that generates the PWM signal for the AC converters.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="541910" data-index="88">And then the motor is not driving the propeller directly on the ArDrone, but there is a small</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="550470" data-index="89">gear in between. Other quadrotors directly drive the propellers, so this depends a little</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="557900" data-index="90">bit on the speed and the power of the motor that you are building into.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="564129" data-index="91">So to summarize the lesson learned today in this video.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="567569" data-index="92">We've looked at DC motors that are used on some quadrotors and brushless motors that</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="571759" data-index="93">are typically used on larger quadrotors. We've looked at the corresponding motor controllers.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="577619" data-index="94">And we've looked at the ArDrone implementation of the motor controllers.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="585119" data-index="95">In the next video we will look at methods for generating suitable control signals, because</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="592400" data-index="96">now the question is, what motor speed do we actually want for each of the four motors?</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="597929" data-index="97">And even at a higher level, what attitude do we want and what velocities do we want</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="604360" data-index="98">of the whole quadrotor?</li><li tabindex="-1" style="height: 215.5px;" class="spacing"></li></ol>
