This vector has two components x and y, which represent the coordinates of this</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="34929" data-index="5">2D point. We can also represent the same 2D point by what's called an augmented vector.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="43300" data-index="6">This is a 3D vector where the first two components represent this point, the coordinates.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="50380" data-index="7">And the third component is just 1. This vector we will denote by x bar.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="56210" data-index="8">At a first glance this makes things more complicated seemingly, but as we will see in this video</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="62540" data-index="9">it actually simplifies calculations, such as intersecting lines and points, and such</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="69710" data-index="10">as representing transformations of these points in terms of simple matrix-vector products.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="77579" data-index="11">Furthermore, we can introduce a representation for 2D points the same 2D point by what's</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="84590" data-index="12">called a homogeneous coordinates, sometimes also called projective coordinates. These</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="91259" data-index="13">are 3D vectors that have three independent components, but the key idea is that two homogenous</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="101119" data-index="14">vectors that only differ by scale actually represent the same 2D point.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="107700" data-index="15">We can then convert back from homogenous to inhomogeneous coordinates, simply by dividing</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="114310" data-index="16">through the last element. So here for example, if you have a homogenous</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="119759" data-index="17">vector with components x tilde, y tilde, w tilde, dividing by the last component w tilde</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="128229" data-index="18">gives you back the 2D coordinates x and y representing this point.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="138269" data-index="19">In particular, of course with homogeneous coordinates, w tilde can become 0. Assume</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="145180" data-index="20">we have a point x tilde with this three components, and we now let w tilde go to 0. Then the point</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="153159" data-index="21">coordinates x and y of this point move towards infinity, and so for w tilde equals 0 these</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="162519" data-index="22">points are called "points at infinity" or "ideal points", and they then in fact represent</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="169549" data-index="23">a direction in space.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="175430" data-index="24">We can represent lines as you all know by some offset from the origin and some direction</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="181900" data-index="25">of the line. In this class we will use a homogeneous coordinate</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="186909" data-index="26">vector l tilde to represent lines. It contains three components a, b, c, and the idea is</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="195010" data-index="27">that any point on the line, written in this augmented vector x bar is on the line, if</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="204980" data-index="28">and only if it is orthogonal to l tilde. So the scalar product of x bar and l tilde</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="213500" data-index="29">being just ax + by + c must be 0.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="220670" data-index="30">Of course, again as with homogeneous coordinates for points, here as well two vectors represent</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="228340" data-index="31">the same line if they only differ by scaling. In particular this allows us to define a normalized</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="238300" data-index="32">line equation, where the homogeneous coordinate vector l tilde, representing the line, is</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="245290" data-index="33">chosen such that the first two components define the normal vector, so a unit vector</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="252700" data-index="34">be that is orthogonal to the line. And then the third component here d is simply the offset</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="261769" data-index="35">from the origin.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="266580" data-index="36">With homogeneous coordinates we can very easily define a line connecting to points. So if</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="273919" data-index="37">we represent these two points x_1 and x_2, in terms of homogeneous coordinates, then</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="281120" data-index="38">the line connecting them is simply given by the cross-product of the homogeneous coordinate vectors.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="288900" data-index="39">Similarly if we want to define the intersection</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="294069" data-index="40">of two lines, represented in homogeneous coordinates by l_1 tilde and l_2 tilde.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="302000" data-index="41">Then the point in their intersection is given by the cross-product of this two vectors. And so here you can see</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="311900" data-index="42">how things like intersecting lines or connecting points with a line can be very easily done</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="321669" data-index="43">in homogeneous or projective coordinates.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="327590" data-index="44">Similarly these projective coordinates help to model 2D transformations of points or lines.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="334500" data-index="45">Here the simplest transformation you can think of is a transformation is a 2D translation.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="341210" data-index="46">That is a vector x is translated to a vector x' simply by adding an offset vector t.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="348200" data-index="47">That's a 2D vector representing this offset. We can represent the same transformation as</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="356900" data-index="48">a matrix-vector product once we write the vector x as an augmented vector. Again the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="364400" data-index="49">third component being 1. Then this x + t can be written as a matrix-vector product with</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="371800" data-index="50">a 2 by 3 matrix where the first block is an identity matrix and the last column is the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="380060" data-index="51">2D translation vector t.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="384259" data-index="52">If we write both the input and output in homogeneous coordinates x tilde and x tilde prime, then</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="392800" data-index="53">the transformed vector is obtained from the original vector x tilde by a matrix multiplication</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="401750" data-index="54">with a 3 by 3 matrix that contains in the upper left corner an identity matrix, the</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="408460" data-index="55">upper right part of the last column is the translation vector and below we have 0s and 1.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="419700" data-index="56">We can generalize the translation by adding a rotation, this leads to what's called a</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="425389" data-index="57">rigid body motion or a euclidian transformation. And in standard 2D coordinates we can write</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="433300" data-index="58">it as Rx + t. In homogenous coordinates, again we can just write it as a matrix-vector product.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="443400" data-index="59">Where the upper left hand corner is the rotation matrix R, containing cosine and sine in for</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="451270" data-index="60">a 2D transformation of this angle Theta the rotation angle. So this is an orthogonal matrix.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="459400" data-index="61">i.e. RR^T = I and it has determinant +1. And again in this matrix the 3 by 3 matrix</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="468700" data-index="62">defining this Euclidian transform the upper right hand corner we have the translation vector t.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="478000" data-index="63">It's actually quit useful that you can write transformations as matrix-vector products,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="484629" data-index="64">because it allows you to very elegantly concatenate transformations. So if you concatenate two</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="491259" data-index="65">rigid body transformations, then it simply amounts to a matrix product of the two matrices.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="500200" data-index="66">Rigid body transformations are transformations which preserve distances and angles, and vice versa.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="507900" data-index="67">One can actually show that any transformation which does preserve distances and angles is</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="514400" data-index="68">in variably a rotation plus translation.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="521260" data-index="69">We can generalize this rigid body transformation by introducing a scaling by a scalar little s here.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="529500" data-index="70">And that leads to what calls a similarity transform that consists of a translation and</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="536500" data-index="71">a scaled rotation. We can write it again in homogeneous coordinates</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="542130" data-index="72">as a matrix-vector product, where the upper left hand corner is the scaled rotation matrix s times R.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="552500" data-index="73">Similarity transforms no longer preserve length because of a potentially non-uniform scaling s</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="561500" data-index="74">but they still preserve angles, as shown in the upper right hand side. So a square</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="567839" data-index="75">for example can be transformed to a rectangle.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="574790" data-index="76">We can further generalize the similarity transform by replacing the rotation matrix in the upper</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="581760" data-index="77">left hand corner by an arbitrary matrix, 2 by 2 matrix. And this leads to what is called</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="588760" data-index="78">an affine transformation. As you can see in a homogenous coordinates this transformation</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="595279" data-index="79">has 6 parameters. And in particular what is preserved in an affine transformation is that</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="603900" data-index="80">parallel lines remain parallel. So angles are no longer preserved in general,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="611000" data-index="81">length is not preserved, but parallel lines remain parallel.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="618700" data-index="82">We can further generalize the affine transformation to the most generic 2D linear transformation,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="627800" data-index="83">and that in homogeneous coordinates. And that is called the homography or projective transformation</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="635200" data-index="84">and that can be written by a matrix large H tilde, which is a homography matrix and this</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="643180" data-index="85">is a 3 by 3 matrix containing 9 elements, but you should remember that we working in</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="651510" data-index="86">homogeneous coordinates.  Meaning that two vectors are identical if the only differ by scaling.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="659700" data-index="87">That implies for two homograph matrices, if the only differ by scaling they actually correspond</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="668190" data-index="88">to the same projective transformation. What is preserved in a homography or projective</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="677600" data-index="89">transformation is that straight lines remain straight lines. So as you can see here in</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="683550" data-index="90">the upper right hand drawing, in the homography transformation of the rectangle: parallel</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="690540" data-index="91">lines do not have to remain to be parallel, but straight lines will always remain straight.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="700320" data-index="92">What have we learned in this video and lecture, we learned about 2D points and 2D line, in</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="707400" data-index="93">particular we learned about homogeneous or projective coordinates for points and lines,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="714339" data-index="94">and we saw that these coordinates drastically facilitate the study of 2D transformations.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="721800" data-index="95">In particular we studied transformations like the translation, the ridged body motion,</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="728500" data-index="96">the similarity transformation, the affine transformation and the most general case the homography or</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="737110" data-index="97">projective transformation.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="740470" data-index="98">In the next video we will study these entities and aspects on a particular example. And this</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="749500" data-index="99">will then lead us to an exercise, where you can learn to apply these techniques in geometry.</li><li tabindex="0" data-start="757500" data-index="100">Thank you</li><li tabindex="-1" style="height: 190px;" class="spacing"></li></ol>
