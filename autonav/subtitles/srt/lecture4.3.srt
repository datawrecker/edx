00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,750
Hello this is video 4.3 on kinematics and dynamics.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,960
In this video we will look at how rigid bodies behave under the influence of forces and torques

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,089
that are being applied to them. And then we will see how we can use that to

4
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,600
model the motion of a quadrotor depending on the thrust of its motors.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,240
So kinematics in general describes the motion of rigid bodies. Typically you can describe

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:37,080
the state of rigid body then in classical mechanics by its position in space, by its current velocity,

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,100
and by its acceleration. And then you can find very simple rules. You know

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,100
that if you integrate up acceleration you get the velocity.

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,049
If you integrate velocity you get position.

10
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:55,780
And just to immediately give you an example how this might look like: imagine that we

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,600
are looking at a rigid body that is living in a 1 dimensional world. So we can describe

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:10,100
its position just by using a scalar x, describing its position in space.

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,490
We can describe its speed also by a single scalar x dot,

14
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,010
and then, its current acceleration by x double dot.

15
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:29,400
And then, we can apply an action. To add that in our example, now just changes are being added to the acceleration

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,920
of this object. And we need a time constant delta t that tells us how much time passes

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,490
by form one moment to the next.

18
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:47,890
And given that we can specify a linear process model that tells us how we can evolve our

19
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:56,200
state from time step t-1 to time step t. And you have probably seen that before you can

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:05,250
say that the current position equals the previous position plus delta t times our current speed.

21
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:12,860
This is the first row of this system matrix, in the second row we have the relationship

22
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:21,000
that the current speed depends on the previous speed plus delta t times our current acceleration.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,400
And we just keep the acceleration the same as long as nothing else happens. And then,

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:38,370
to this state we add our control input u. Just by this simple vector 0,0,1, which just means

25
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:48,410
that we add the action to our acceleration. And using that you can already get a simple dynamical

26
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:54,209
system of an object that floats in 1 dimensional space.

27
00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:06,230
Now dynamics is the theory that relates forces and torques to such accelerations, as you

28
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,230
might know from school: forces induce a linear acceleration on the body, while torques induce

29
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,300
an angular acceleration. You can say that a torque is the turning-force that makes something turn.

30
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:28,510
Let's start with forces first, a force can be represented by a vector and they can be

31
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:35,020
summed up. So if you for example apply two forces to

32
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,400
this soccer ball here in x and y direction, then this corresponds exactly to the force as if you

33
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,319
would have applied a force along this diagonal line F_x + F_y.

34
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:52,620
And the force that you apply to an object directly relates to the acceleration that

35
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:00,519
this object perceives. And this acceleration then also depends on

36
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,959
the mass of the object, so a heavier object is more difficult of course to be accelerated

37
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,550
or to be moved.

38
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:16,700
A torque you can say, loosely speaking, is the turning-force.

39
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,789
So if you have a lever arm that you try to move you can apply a force on one side

40
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:27,199
and that will induce then a torque on the rotation axis.

41
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,759
And this torque that is generated depends on two things: it depends on the force of

42
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,500
course, the more force you apply to a lever arm the more torque you get. And then again,

43
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:46,039
it depends on the distance of the place where you apply the force and the rotation center

44
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,990
which is denoted here in this graphics by r.

45
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,699
And as before, it also depends on the mass or the mass distribution on the object, which

46
00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:04,449
is typically captured by this inertial matrix J here that then relates the torque to the

47
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:10,889
angular acceleration, here denoted by bold alpha.

48
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:18,979
And now let's see how this translate to quadrotors. As you have seen before, the quadrotor consists

49
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:25,710
of 4 propellers, and every propeller generates some thrust. And this induces a certain force,

50
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:32,629
so we have now 4 sources of force that push the quadrotor up.

51
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:38,319
And we have the gravitational force that pulls the quadrotor down at the same time.

52
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:46,700
And if we count all of this forces together in the vertical case then the quadrotor hovers

53
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:53,330
exactly in place, if the thrust forces of all for rotors exactly match the gravitational

54
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,800
force that pulls it down again.

55
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,800
And at the same time, every propeller also induces the torque, which is the counter torque

56
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,389
that's generated by the propellers moving the air.

57
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:15,089
And we have to make sure that all of this torques actually sum to 0, in order not to get any motion.

58
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:21,419
So this graphics shows again, now if we want to hover in place all of the 4 forces have

59
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:28,319
to equal the gravitational force, if it's larger, then we actually accelerate to the

60
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:28,559
top.

61
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:35,869
So the resulting force is the force that is being applied to the body of the quadrotor.

62
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:42,869
Now if we turn the quadrotor slightly, then this thrust force is not in a line any more

63
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:55,800
with the gravitation. And this means that we can separate this resulting force from the motor thrust

64
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,139
into a vertical component F_z that compensates then for the gravity or that has to compensate

65
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,500
for the gravity if you want to keep the same position. And an x and y component that actually

66
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,289
makes the quadrotor go forward or sideways.

67
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:23,309
And because all of these forces are actually vectors, we have to transform the thrust vector

68
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:31,610
into the global coordinate system by using for example a rotation matrix to be able to

69
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:37,529
compute the acceleration in global coordinates.

70
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:46,889
Then if we want to change the attitude of our quadrotor, we can bring the motors into

71
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:53,700
a mode where the two opposite motors produce  a unequal thrust, and this then induces a

72
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,429
certain torque around the rotation axis or the center of the mass of the quadrotor.

73
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:07,000
And again, by the formula from a few slides before we can then compute the resulting torque and that leads giving

74
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,369
that inertial matrix J to a certain induced angular acceleration alpha.

75
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:24,199
And then for rotating around the vertical axis we can also modulate the speeds of the

76
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:32,370
rotors in such a way that the sum of the torques does not equals 0 any more, but the left

77
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,809
turning motors are turning faster than the right turning ones for example. And that

78
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:40,380
induces the torque on the overall system.

79
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,530
So this already summarizes this video, we have looked at rigid body kinematics. Just

80
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:53,080
remember that every rigid body can be described using its position, velocity, and acceleration.

81
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:02,600
And then we looked at what accelerations forces and torques actually produce.

82
00:09:02,600 --> 23:59:59,999
And then, we just applied that to quadrotors because this is what we need.
