00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,680
Hello and welcome back to lecture 2.2 on 2D geometry.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:14,200
In this video I will introduce the basic concepts of 2D points and lines, and we will discuss

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:20,390
how to transform these entities using 2D transformations.

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:27,390
As you all know we can represent 2D points, as a 2D vector which we will denote by a

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,929
boldface x. This vector has two components x and y, which represent the coordinates of this

6
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:43,300
2D point. We can also represent the same 2D point by what's called an augmented vector.

7
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:50,380
This is a 3D vector where the first two components represent this point, the coordinates.

8
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,210
And the third component is just 1. This vector we will denote by x bar.

9
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,540
At a first glance this makes things more complicated seemingly, but as we will see in this video

10
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:09,710
it actually simplifies calculations, such as intersecting lines and points, and such

11
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:17,579
as representing transformations of these points in terms of simple matrix-vector products.

12
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:24,590
Furthermore, we can introduce a representation for 2D points the same 2D point by what's

13
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:31,259
called a homogeneous coordinates, sometimes also called projective coordinates. These

14
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:41,119
are 3D vectors that have three independent components, but the key idea is that two homogenous

15
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,700
vectors that only differ by scale actually represent the same 2D point.

16
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,310
We can then convert back from homogenous to inhomogeneous coordinates, simply by dividing

17
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,759
through the last element. So here for example, if you have a homogenous

18
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:08,229
vector with components x tilde, y tilde, w tilde, dividing by the last component w tilde

19
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:18,269
gives you back the 2D coordinates x and y representing this point.

20
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:25,180
In particular, of course with homogeneous coordinates, w tilde can become 0. Assume

21
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:33,159
we have a point x tilde with this three components, and we now let w tilde go to 0. Then the point

22
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:42,519
coordinates x and y of this point move towards infinity, and so for w tilde equals 0 these

23
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:49,549
points are called "points at infinity" or "ideal points", and they then in fact represent

24
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:55,430
a direction in space.

25
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,900
We can represent lines as you all know by some offset from the origin and some direction

26
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,909
of the line. In this class we will use a homogeneous coordinate

27
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:15,010
vector l tilde to represent lines. It contains three components a, b, c, and the idea is

28
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:24,980
that any point on the line, written in this augmented vector x bar is on the line, if

29
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:33,500
and only if it is orthogonal to l tilde. So the scalar product of x bar and l tilde

30
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:40,670
being just ax + by + c must be 0.

31
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:48,340
Of course, again as with homogeneous coordinates for points, here as well two vectors represent

32
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:58,300
the same line if they only differ by scaling. In particular this allows us to define a normalized

33
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:05,290
line equation, where the homogeneous coordinate vector l tilde, representing the line, is

34
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:12,700
chosen such that the first two components define the normal vector, so a unit vector

35
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:21,769
be that is orthogonal to the line. And then the third component here d is simply the offset

36
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,580
from the origin.

37
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,919
With homogeneous coordinates we can very easily define a line connecting to points. So if

38
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:41,120
we represent these two points x_1 and x_2, in terms of homogeneous coordinates, then

39
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,900
the line connecting them is simply given by the cross-product of the homogeneous coordinate vectors.

40
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,069
Similarly if we want to define the intersection

41
00:04:54,069 --> 00:05:02,000
of two lines, represented in homogeneous coordinates by l_1 tilde and l_2 tilde.

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,900
Then the point in their intersection is given by the cross-product of this two vectors. And so here you can see

43
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:21,669
how things like intersecting lines or connecting points with a line can be very easily done

44
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:27,590
in homogeneous or projective coordinates.

45
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:34,500
Similarly these projective coordinates help to model 2D transformations of points or lines.

46
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,210
Here the simplest transformation you can think of is a transformation is a 2D translation.

47
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:48,200
That is a vector x is translated to a vector x' simply by adding an offset vector t.

48
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:56,900
That's a 2D vector representing this offset. We can represent the same transformation as

49
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:04,400
a matrix-vector product once we write the vector x as an augmented vector. Again the

50
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,800
third component being 1. Then this x + t can be written as a matrix-vector product with

51
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:20,060
a 2 by 3 matrix where the first block is an identity matrix and the last column is the

52
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,259
2D translation vector t.

53
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:32,800
If we write both the input and output in homogeneous coordinates x tilde and x tilde prime, then

54
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:41,750
the transformed vector is obtained from the original vector x tilde by a matrix multiplication

55
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:48,460
with a 3 by 3 matrix that contains in the upper left corner an identity matrix, the

56
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:59,700
upper right part of the last column is the translation vector and below we have 0s and 1.

57
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,389
We can generalize the translation by adding a rotation, this leads to what's called a

58
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:13,300
rigid body motion or a euclidian transformation. And in standard 2D coordinates we can write

59
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:23,400
it as Rx + t. In homogenous coordinates, again we can just write it as a matrix-vector product.

60
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:31,270
Where the upper left hand corner is the rotation matrix R, containing cosine and sine in for

61
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:39,400
a 2D transformation of this angle Theta the rotation angle. So this is an orthogonal matrix.

62
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:48,700
i.e. RR^T = I and it has determinant +1. And again in this matrix the 3 by 3 matrix

63
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:58,000
defining this Euclidian transform the upper right hand corner we have the translation vector t.

64
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,629
It's actually quit useful that you can write transformations as matrix-vector products,

65
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:11,259
because it allows you to very elegantly concatenate transformations. So if you concatenate two

66
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:20,200
rigid body transformations, then it simply amounts to a matrix product of the two matrices.

67
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:27,900
Rigid body transformations are transformations which preserve distances and angles, and vice versa.

68
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:34,400
One can actually show that any transformation which does preserve distances and angles is

69
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:41,260
in variably a rotation plus translation.

70
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:49,500
We can generalize this rigid body transformation by introducing a scaling by a scalar little s here.

71
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:56,500
And that leads to what calls a similarity transform that consists of a translation and

72
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,130
a scaled rotation. We can write it again in homogeneous coordinates

73
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:12,500
as a matrix-vector product, where the upper left hand corner is the scaled rotation matrix s times R.

74
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Similarity transforms no longer preserve length because of a potentially non-uniform scaling s

75
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,839
but they still preserve angles, as shown in the upper right hand side. So a square

76
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,790
for example can be transformed to a rectangle.

77
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:41,760
We can further generalize the similarity transform by replacing the rotation matrix in the upper

78
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,760
left hand corner by an arbitrary matrix, 2 by 2 matrix. And this leads to what is called

79
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:55,279
an affine transformation. As you can see in a homogenous coordinates this transformation

80
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:03,900
has 6 parameters. And in particular what is preserved in an affine transformation is that

81
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:11,000
parallel lines remain parallel. So angles are no longer preserved in general,

82
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,700
length is not preserved, but parallel lines remain parallel.

83
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:27,800
We can further generalize the affine transformation to the most generic 2D linear transformation,

84
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:35,200
and that in homogeneous coordinates. And that is called the homography or projective transformation

85
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:43,180
and that can be written by a matrix large H tilde, which is a homography matrix and this

86
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:51,510
is a 3 by 3 matrix containing 9 elements, but you should remember that we working in

87
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:59,700
homogeneous coordinates.  Meaning that two vectors are identical if the only differ by scaling.

88
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:08,190
That implies for two homograph matrices, if the only differ by scaling they actually correspond

89
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:17,600
to the same projective transformation. What is preserved in a homography or projective

90
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,550
transformation is that straight lines remain straight lines. So as you can see here in

91
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:30,540
the upper right hand drawing, in the homography transformation of the rectangle: parallel

92
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:40,320
lines do not have to remain to be parallel, but straight lines will always remain straight.

93
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,400
What have we learned in this video and lecture, we learned about 2D points and 2D line, in

94
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:54,339
particular we learned about homogeneous or projective coordinates for points and lines,

95
00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:01,800
and we saw that these coordinates drastically facilitate the study of 2D transformations.

96
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:08,500
In particular we studied transformations like the translation, the ridged body motion,

97
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:17,110
the similarity transformation, the affine transformation and the most general case the homography or

98
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,470
projective transformation.

99
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:29,500
In the next video we will study these entities and aspects on a particular example. And this

100
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:37,500
will then lead us to an exercise, where you can learn to apply these techniques in geometry.

101
00:12:37,500 --> 23:59:59,999
Thank you
