00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,801

2
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:02,300
Hello.

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,620
And welcome back, everybody, to the second part

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,110
of the first lecture on autonomous

5
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,250
navigation for flying robots.

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,520
In this video, I will briefly illustrate a few

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,220
of the use cases of quadrotors and with that

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,430
motivate why we believe that quadrotors will become really

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,050
relevant commercially but also scientifically

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,490
in the near future.

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,050
So before we start with the more technical applications,

12
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,140
let me first ask you to think personally

13
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,660
what you would like to use such a quadrotor for.

14
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,160
And for the moment, just think of it

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,310
as an autonomously flying camera.

16
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,230
And then, depending on your personal interests,

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,250
you might come up with the idea that you could film yourself

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,070
during your next ski run, to have a camera that just follows

19
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,400
you automatically or that flies in front of you

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,800
and takes really nice imagery.

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,870
In a similar application, quadrotors

22
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,200
could also be real life-savers.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,470
For example, after an avalanche goes off,

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,200
you could send out a team of quadrotors

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,910
to quickly monitor the hill from above

26
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:14,540
to get visual imagery such that the rescue forces can quickly

27
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,351
come to the victims and save them.

28
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:20,620

29
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,770
Similarly, also after nature catastrophes,

30
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,650
like a tsunami, of course, or an earthquake,

31
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,040
quadrotors are really versatile helpers

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,790
that can be sent into buildings to inspect them.

33
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,600
In particular, if you're not sure

34
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,990
whether the building is still safe for humans,

35
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,910
if possibly the building could collapse,

36
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,340
then you better send in a robot.

37
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,950
And quadrotors have the advantage

38
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,300
that they are not obstructed by debris on the floor.

39
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,780
So imagine you would send in a wheeled robot,

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,800
then it might get stuck very soon if there

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,200
are stones or parts of the wall lying on the floor.

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,770
Similarly, and more interesting for personal use,

43
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,130
are quadrotors that you can send above your house,

44
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,750
to check for example the roof for damages after a storm.

45
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,820
Similarly also for inspecting buildings in general.

46
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,110
So for example, bridges have to be inspected on a yearly basis.

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,740
And that's a quite expensive effort,

48
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:30,010
because you have to have one or two inspectors being

49
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,740
transported next to the supporting

50
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,890
structure of a bridge to look visually

51
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,320
at the state of the pillars.

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,670
And if you had a very easy to use flying camera for that,

53
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,910
then that would save enormous amounts of money and time,

54
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,850
obviously.

55
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,290
Another application is in remote farming.

56
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,950
You could send out quadrotors quickly to crop fields

57
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,610
to check whether addition watering is needed,

58
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,760
whether the plants are healthy, to monitor a field in general.

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,620
But then even if you detect certain diseases,

60
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,970
you could spray certain substances

61
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:18,567
on the plants very precisely and exactly the right amount based

62
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:19,650
on your visual inspection.

63
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,220

64
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,900
Another huge topic, of course, is to map,

65
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,730
to use quadrotors to map buildings,

66
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,370
both from the outside and the inside.

67
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,280
I guess most of you will already have

68
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,210
taken measurements of your own apartment.

69
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,840
If you're moving to a new flat, you

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,490
have to take all the measurements of the furniture

71
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,120
and of the rooms and doors.

72
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,990
And if you had an automatic tool,

73
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,820
like a small quadrotor, that you could send in a room

74
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,970
and would generate a 3D map, this would be very helpful.

75
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,130
So this helps people, common people like you and me.

76
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,430
But it also helps, of course, architects to quickly

77
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,940
scan in huge buildings to get such 3D maps.

78
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,150
This is also highly relevant for industrial applications.

79
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,850
If you look at production sites, then most of the time

80
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,250
there is also no accurate floor plan.

81
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,550
And similarly, walking around and taking all the measurements

82
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,870
can be quite cumbersome.

83
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,160
And also if you have three-dimensional structures

84
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,200
like pipes and so on, then it's not

85
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,700
really easy to create such a map manually.

86
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,340
Also very interesting, but still at a quite early stage,

87
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,040
are transportation tasks for quadrotors.

88
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,660
Amazon launched recently a video showing an octocopter

89
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,140
transporting a package to a customer.

90
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,170
This was more a proof of concept, of course,

91
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,280
because there are so many unresolved legal issues there.

92
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,970

93
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,800
And then also Domino's Pizza showed a video

94
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,490
where they delivered a pizza to a client.

95
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,360
So while this is still at an early stage,

96
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,790
it's clear that with quadrotors, we're

97
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,580
actually close to implementing such applications.

98
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,680
So with that, I've shown that there

99
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,390
are many useful applications for quadrotors.

100
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,350
And that it also has a large commercial potential

101
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,280
for the future.

102
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,400
However, current solutions require typically

103
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,490
a skilled human pilot that navigates manually

104
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,600
the quadrotor in these applications.

105
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,730
And that obviously limits the applicability.

106
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,070
This again motivates the main question in this course,

107
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,820
namely, how can we increase the autonomy of flying robots?

108
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,930

109
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,780
This brings me down then to our first exercise,

110
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,150
interactive exercise that we have prepared for you.

111
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,750
So we would like you to propose one or more ideas what

112
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,510
you would like to use an autonomous

113
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,230
quadrotor for once it exists.

114
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,120
And then just write this idea in the message forum.

115
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,370
And then vote for your favorite idea.

116
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,300
And then we also would like you to discuss there

117
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,020
what the particular challenges are of each of these ideas

118
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,900
and how large the commercial potential is.

119
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,470
And then, based on your proposals,

120
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,610
we will discuss the three most popular ideas next week

121
00:06:14,610 --> 23:59:59,999
in class.
